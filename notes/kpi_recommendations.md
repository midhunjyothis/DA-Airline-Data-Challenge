# KPI Recommendations

These KPIs are designed to track the ongoing performance of the recommended round-trip routes, aligned with profitability, operational reliability, and a punctuality-focused brand.

## Financial Performance KPIs
- **Profit per Round Trip**  
  Measures unit economics of each route and ensures profitability remains above breakeven assumptions.

- **Total Route Profit (Quarterly)**  
  Tracks whether each route continues to justify the dedicated aircraft investment.

- **Revenue per Passenger**  
  Helps monitor yield changes over time without relying solely on total volume.

## Operational Reliability KPIs
- **On-Time Departure Rate (≤15 minutes)**  
  Directly tied to the brand promise and avoids incremental delay costs.

- **On-Time Arrival Rate (≤15 minutes)**  
  Complements departure punctuality and reflects end-to-end customer experience.

- **Average Delay Minutes per Flight**  
  Early indicator of rising operational risk and cost pressure.

## Demand & Utilization KPIs
- **Average Occupancy Rate**  
  Validates demand assumptions used in revenue modeling.

- **Round-Trip Utilization per Aircraft**  
  Ensures each dedicated airplane is being used efficiently.

## Risk Monitoring KPIs
- **Delay Cost as % of Total Cost**  
  Flags routes where congestion or operational issues are eroding margins.

- **Airport Fee Cost per Round Trip**  
  Helps monitor exposure to high-cost airports over time.

## Why These KPIs
These metrics directly map back to the cost and revenue components used in the analysis, allowing leadership to monitor performance, detect drift from assumptions, and intervene early if route economics deteriorate.
