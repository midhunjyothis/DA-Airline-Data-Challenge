# KPI Recommendations

## Financial Performance
- **Profit per Round Trip**  
  Tracks unit economics and validates breakeven assumptions.

- **Total Route Profit (Quarterly)**  
  Ensures each route continues to justify a dedicated aircraft.

- **Revenue per Passenger**  
  Monitors yield changes independent of volume.

## Operational Reliability
- **On-Time Departure Rate (≤15 minutes)**  
  Directly tied to the brand promise and delay-related cost exposure.

- **On-Time Arrival Rate (≤15 minutes)**  
  Captures end-to-end punctuality from a customer perspective.

- **Average Delay Minutes per Flight**  
  Early signal of rising operational risk.

## Demand & Utilization
- **Average Occupancy Rate**  
  Validates demand assumptions used in revenue modeling.

- **Round-Trip Utilization per Aircraft**  
  Confirms effective use of each dedicated plane.

## Risk Monitoring
- **Delay Cost as % of Total Cost**  
  Highlights routes where congestion is eroding margins.

- **Airport Fees per Round Trip**  
  Tracks exposure to high-cost airports over time.
