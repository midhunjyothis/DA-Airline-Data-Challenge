# What I Would Do Next With More Time

## Improve Revenue Accuracy
- Use full ticket pricing data (not sampled) to reduce noise on low-volume routes.
- Segment fares by time-of-day and day-of-week to capture yield variation.
- Incorporate ancillary revenue beyond baggage where available.

## Strengthen Operational Modeling
- Model delay distributions instead of averages to better quantify tail risk.
- Separate weather-driven delays from airport congestion effects.
- Stress-test profitability under degraded on-time performance scenarios.

## Automation & Monitoring
- Convert the notebook into a scheduled pipeline with automated KPI refresh.
- Add data quality alerts for missing occupancy, fare, or delay fields.
- Persist route-level metrics for trend monitoring across quarters.

## Scenario & Risk Analysis
- Simulate fuel cost sensitivity and airport fee changes.
- Evaluate impact of adding or removing flight frequency per route.
- Assess breakeven robustness under demand shocks.

## Decision Support Enhancements
- Build a lightweight dashboard for route executives focused on KPIs and alerts.
- Track variance between modeled assumptions and realized performance over time.
