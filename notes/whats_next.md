# What I Would Do Next With More Time

## Revenue Accuracy
- Use full ticket pricing data to reduce noise on low-volume routes.
- Segment fares by time of day and day of week.
- Include additional ancillary revenue where available.

## Operational Modeling
- Model delay distributions instead of averages to capture tail risk.
- Separate weather-driven delays from airport congestion.
- Stress-test profitability under degraded on-time performance.

## Automation & Monitoring
- Convert the notebook into a scheduled pipeline with automated KPI refresh.
- Add data quality checks for missing occupancy, fare, and delay fields.
- Persist route-level metrics to track trends across quarters.

## Scenario & Risk Analysis
- Simulate sensitivity to fuel costs and airport fee changes.
- Evaluate the impact of adjusting flight frequency per route.
- Test breakeven robustness under demand shocks.

## Decision Support
- Build a lightweight dashboard focused on route KPIs and alerts.
- Track variance between modeled assumptions and realized performance.
