# Final Route Recommendations

## Recommended 5 Round-Trip Routes

1. **JFK – LAX**  
   Highest modeled profitability with sustained volume. Serves as a core long-haul route with strong unit economics.

2. **JFK – SFO**  
   High-yield business route with solid profitability and manageable delay exposure.

3. **LAX – SFO**  
   Very high frequency and demand. Higher airport fees are offset by volume and operational familiarity.

4. **LGA – ORD**  
   Major business corridor with strong margins and predictable demand.

5. **ATL – LGA**  
   Consistent profitability and high network connectivity with relatively controlled delay costs.

## Explicitly Not Selected
- **SLC – TWF**  
  Appears highly profitable in the model but driven by very low volume and sensitivity to sampled ticket data. Treated as a data artifact rather than an investable route.

## Summary
The selected routes balance profitability, scale, and operational reliability. Preference is given to routes with sustained demand and predictable operations over extreme but fragile profit signals.
