# Final Route Recommendations

## Recommended 5 Round-Trip Routes

1. **JFK – LAX**  
   Highest modeled profitability with strong, sustained volume. A core long-haul route that anchors the network and absorbs fixed costs well.

2. **JFK – SFO**  
   High-yield business corridor with solid profitability and manageable delay exposure relative to revenue.

3. **LAX – SFO**  
   Extremely high frequency and demand. Despite higher airport fees, operational familiarity and volume support reliability and utilization.

4. **LGA – ORD**  
   One of the busiest domestic business routes with strong margins and predictable demand patterns.

5. **ATL – LGA**  
   High network connectivity and consistent profitability with relatively controlled delay costs.

## Explicitly Not Selected
- **SLC – TWF**  
  Modeled as highly profitable but driven by very low volume and likely sensitivity to sampled ticket data. Treated as a data artifact rather than an investable route.

## Rationale Summary
These routes balance profitability, scale, and operational credibility while aligning with a punctuality-focused brand. Selection favors routes with sustained demand and predictable operations over extreme but fragile profit signals.
