# Route Recommendation Criteria

## Objective
Select 5 round-trip routes that balance profitability, scale, and operational reliability, consistent with a punctuality-focused brand.

## Primary Criteria
- Route-level profitability based on modeled revenue and costs
- Sufficient round-trip volume to support steady aircraft utilization
- Medium or large airports on both ends of the route

## Secondary Criteria
- Lower exposure to extreme delay costs
- Demand not driven by isolated or one-off spikes
- Routes that are operationally common and well understood

## Explicit Tradeoffs
- Very low-volume routes are deprioritized, even if highly profitable
- Routes with thin or noisy ticket samples are treated cautiously
- Absolute profit is evaluated alongside operational stability

## Not Optimized For
- Short-term revenue maximization at the expense of reliability
- Perfect demand forecasting
- Carrier- or aircraft-specific scheduling advantages

## Application
- Start from the most profitable routes
- Apply volume and reliability filters
- Use judgment to select the final 5 routes
