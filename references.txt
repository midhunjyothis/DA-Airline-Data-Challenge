References & Acknowledgements

During development, I referenced:

My personal Python-based analytics code vaults accumulated from prior projects, primarily for structuring reusable functions and handling real-world data issues.

General Python data analysis patterns that I routinely use in my work.

Also used GitHub Copilot autocomplete for comments and code not directly related to core logic or context

I also had informal technical discussions with:

Ankith — Software Engineer at PayPal, primarily around Python code structuring and modularization practices.

Rahman — R&D Intern at Corteva Agriscience, primarily around sanity-checking aggregations and validating interpretation of results.
