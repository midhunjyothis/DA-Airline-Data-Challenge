References & Acknowledgements

During development, I referenced:

My personal Python-based analytics code vaults accumulated from prior projects, primarily for structuring reusable functions and handling real-world data issues.

General Python data analysis patterns that I routinely use in my work.

I also had informal technical discussions with:

Ankith — Software Engineer at PayPal, primarily around Python code structuring and modularization practices.
